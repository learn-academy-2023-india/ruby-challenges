#1 Create a loop that prints the numbers 1 to 20.
# for counting in 1..20
#     puts counting
# end

#2 Create a loop that prints the numbers 1 to 20 using a different approach than previously used
# counter = 1
#  while counter <= 20
#     puts counter 
#     counter =+ 1
#  end


 #3 Create a loop that prints only even numbers from 20 to 0
# num = 20
# while num >= 0
#     p num
#     num -= 2
# end

#4 Create a method that takes in an array of numbers and returns a new array with all the numbers multiplied by 5
# variable_name = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# cooler_variable_name = variable_name.map do |value|
#     value * 5
# end

# puts cooler_variable_name

#5 Create a method that takes in an array of lowercase words and capitalizes all of the words, permanently modifying the original array.
# gas_giants = ['neptume', 'uranus', 'saturn', 'jupiter']

# def upper_case planets
#     planets.map!(&:capitalize!)
# end

# upper_case(gas_giants)

# puts gas_giants

#6 Create a method that takes in an array of numbers and returns the largest number in the array
num_bah = [24, 42, 69, 420, 5318008]

def highest(numbers)
    highest_number
